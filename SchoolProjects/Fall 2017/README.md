Java Projects that I did in Data Structures Class in Fall 2017


Big Integer
A command line interface program to parse, add, subtract, and multiply integers larger than can be stored in the int datatype.
BigInteger class was the class I had to edit to make the program meet the specifications.

Expression
A project that involved using stacks and recursion to solve an arithmetic equation
Expression class was the class I had to edit to make the program meet the specifications.

Trie
A command line program to take words in a text file and generate a prefix-trie
Also implemented trie-search to search for words fulfilling a prefix in the trie
Trie class was the class I had to edit to make the program meet the specifications.

Little Search Engine
A command line program to take text from text file(s) and generate searcheable hashtables representing a "word index"
LittleSearchEngine class was the class I had to edit to make the program meet the specifications.

Friends
A command line program to take a text file with data formatted to described person relationships and create a graph
Graph also allows for searching of:
"cliques" or islands of friends
Shortest chain between two people
"Connectors" –– individuals who, when removed from the graph, cause other individuals to be separated entirely from another side of the graph
Friends class was the class I had to edit to make the program meet the specifications.
