C Projects that I did in Principles of Programming Languages Class in Fall 2018

Handshaking Path
This project involves setting up handshakes to help find the closest strongest match.

TinyL Compiler
This project involved being able to compile TinyL language.

I also took Principles of Information and Data Management in which we had to create a mySQL database that needed to be queried and updated.
We also had to write noSQL and mongoDB queries to practice those skills.
