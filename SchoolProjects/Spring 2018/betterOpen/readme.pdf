The libnetfiles.c is meant for access to read and write from a fileserver.
To setup the server put netfileserver on the server you wish to gain files from and run /server to start it
The commands in libnetfiles are netserverinit which is needed to link the fileserver and the client. This needs to be run before any of the other commands;
Usage netserverinit(char *hostname, int filemode). The file modes are 0 for Unrestricted, 1 for exclusive, and 2 for transaction mode.
The other commands are netopen/netread/netwrite/netclose. You can get a file descriptor that works with the net commands with netopen.
Netopen/netread/netwrite/netclose work just like open/read/write/close on the netfileserver and it brings it back to the client.
